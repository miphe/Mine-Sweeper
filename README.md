Mine Sweeper
===========

Personal tiny project, writing Mine Sweeper in js.

### How to play

**The rules in Minesweeper are simple:**

- Uncover a mine, and the game ends.
- Uncover an empty square, and you keep playing.
- Uncover a number, and it tells you how many mines lay hidden in the eight surrounding squaresâ€”information you use to deduce which nearby squares are safe to click.
